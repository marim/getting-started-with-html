1. Intro to internet<br>
The <b>browser</b> of the user connects to the <b>internet </b>
which connects and retrieves information<br>
from  the <b>servers</b> and vice versa. 
Information is transferred between these with <b>http</b>. <br>
<br>
2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) <br>
HTML is the language used for the majority of contents on the web.   
HTML includes the “text”<br>
that is visible on the browser and also instruction on 
how that text will appear. <br>
<br>

<em>example 1 : </em> (b) this is an examples (/b) <br>
The whole line is called a <b>HTML element</b>.  (b)and (/b) are examples of <b>tags</b>.<br>
Some html elements can include an <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&v=-0S9lBFHeo0">attribute</a></b>,
which determines the property of the HTML element. <br>
<br>
<em>example2</em> : 
(a href=”www.google.com”)…(/a)  <br>
href is the attribute.<br>
<br>
